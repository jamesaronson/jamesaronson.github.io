1. I have implemented all aspect of the assignment correctly except for the redirect from my comp sci web space. I originally had the incorrect url redirect. However, when I fixed this in my index.html file in my public_html folder, it did not update the actual redirect on my 
www.eecs.tufts.edu/~jarons03 page. I have not yet figured out why it did not update. 
2.I did not collaborate with anyone.
3. Including time spent reviewing html and css, I spent approximately 7 hours on this project.
